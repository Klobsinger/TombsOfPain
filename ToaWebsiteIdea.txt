<!--
Create a website based on my experience in osrs Raids 3 focused on creating different links within
a main hub with features such as:

- A list of Killing mechanics with pictures that can be clicked to increase the tally maybe
some sort of graph to compare death locations. 

-A Tally of total deaths including how much money it has cost me to die 

-Amount of clears on a day with percentage comparing it to fails include resets

-clearing percent based on raid level?

-a list of drops that i recieved (purples) and what raid level they were got on? maybe a table with
pictures

                                    (Advanced)
- create a section that can be cycled through during the raid with info charts based on the 
current room, fails percentages mech fails, time taken?, deaths, fail percentage have the cycle
be reacting to what is coming from runelite and automattically switch to the correct part of the
website. if that is too hard have a hotkey that cycles to the next area based on a run.(tell the 
program before hand what order the bosses will be done in and then have them ordered and cycled
through)
